The Jupyter notebook Thoracic Surgery Analysis contains the main code.

Abstract

The data is dedicated to the classification problem related to the post-operative life expectancy in the lung cancer patients: class 1 - death within one year after surgery, class 2 - survival.

Data Set Information

The data was collected retrospectively at Wroclaw Thoracic Surgery Centre for patients who underwent major lung resections for primary lung cancer in the years 2007-2011. The Centre is associated with the Department of Thoracic Surgery of the Medical University of Wroclaw and Lower-Silesian Centre for Pulmonary Diseases, Poland, while the research database constitutes a part of the National Lung Cancer Registry, administered by the Institute of Tuberculosis and Pulmonary Diseases in Warsaw, Poland.

The data folder contains the converted data file in CSV format. The Jupyter notebook file shows how the original data set was cleaned to be used for this project.
